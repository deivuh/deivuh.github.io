  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of us have  probably come up with a cool idea for an app at one time or another: the app that no one else seems to have come up with, or just an app that we believe that everyone needs. Some of us just let the idea pass, while others, inspired by that idea, proceed to brainstorm, plan and start building that app.</p>

<p>Months later, while some have published their app, the rest of us have probably <del>stalled</del> abandoned the project, or let it fall to the bottom of the list of our priorities, and started working on another idea. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Even though I usually don’t have problems delivering projects to clients, I do struggle delivering my own projects. Why? Because it’s my own project, and we developers tend to be perfectionists when we are talking about making our own product. By being perfectionists, I mean that we never stop looking to add more features to our project, or ditching what we have done because we just found out that there are better ways to do it.</p>

<p>By getting my <del>first</del> personal app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twenty-one-form-new-habits/id903695313?mt=8">TwentyOne</a>, published on the App Store, I learned some important things to consider when working on a personal project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple days ago, browsing the web, I came across this <a href="http://blog.andrewsomething.com/2014/04/25/digitalocean-indicator-release/">DigitalOcean Indicator</a> made by <a href="http://blog.andrewsomething.com">Andrewsomething</a>. Which manages <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> droplets easily from right Ubuntu&rsquo;s panel.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;ve got droplets to manage, and there was no OSX version for such a handy tool, I decided to make an OSX version of it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/DODropletsManager/screenshot.png" title="Droplets Manager" ></p>

<p>So far, the manager does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>List droplets</li>
<li>Show each droplets status, IP address, distro and region</li>
<li>Copy droplet&rsquo;s IP address to clipboard</li>
<li>Reboot, shutdown and power on droplets</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because I tend to be more focused and productive at late night, I usually stay up late working on some stuff that needs to be done.</p>

<p>Most of the time these stuff involves using my PC, and <a href="http://chriskresser.com/how-artificial-light-is-wrecking-your-sleep-and-what-to-do-about-it">staying up late in front of a screen messes up with our sleep</a>, as it <a href="http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20030620/nighttime-computer-users-may-lose-sleep">lowers our bodies melatonin production</a>. So unless I worked until I felt exhausted, there was no way I could fall asleep within 30 minutes of going to bed.</p>

<p>That was before I discovered <a href="http://justgetflux.com">F.lux</a> a software that adapts your screen to the time of the day. Basically it decreases your screen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature">color temperature</a> at night, and becomes warmer the later at night it is. On their website they even have <a href="http://justgetflux.com/research.html">more information and a collection of links to research documents about light exposure effects on sleeping</a>.</p>

<p><a href="(http://justgetflux.com">F.lux</a>  solves my watching the screen in the dark troubles, but when I needed to do stuff at my desk and not on the screen, all I had was my cool white desk lamp.</p>

<h2>Dagr</h2>

<p>Inspired by F.lux, I decided to make my own light system that changes the color temperature according to the time of the day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I finally built the <em>Gunpla</em> I got a couple years ago (Which I&rsquo;ll write about  later on). I felt more interested about the series, <a href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_00">Gundam 00</a>.</p>

<p>Since I watch most of the series and movies with <a href="https://plex.tv">Plex</a>, I set everything up to watch these new series on my TV. The opening started to play, but there was something missing: The subs! Unless you understand Japanese, subtitles are essential.</p>

<p>Unable to watch anything, I tried to figure out whether it was my TV&rsquo;s Plex client or the Plex Media server configuration. Searching on the web, I found out that the problem was that Samsung&rsquo;s Plex App doesn&rsquo;t support embedded subtitles (e.g. subtitles contained in a MKV container file).</p>

<p>But subtitle files on the same root directory were supported, so what I had to do was to use two tools form <a href="http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/">MKVtoolsnix</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>mkvinfo</em></strong> to identify the track inside the MKV containing the subtitles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>mkvextract</em></strong> to extract the subtitles from the identified track.
Since mkvextract is a command line tool, all I needed was to make a small bash script to iterate and extract the subttiles file from each of the MKV files from the current directory:</p></li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="k">for </span>file in *.mkv
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">  </span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$file</span> | cut -f1 -d<span class="s1">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class="sb">`</span>     
</span><span class='line'>  mkvextract tracks <span class="s2">&quot;$file&quot;</span> TRACKNUMBER:<span class="s2">&quot;$name&quot;</span>.ass
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Even though each subtitle file was extracted and named the same as it&rsquo;s corresponding video file, the same problem persisted, the subtitle files were detected but not shown.</p>

<p>It turns out that Samsung&rsquo;s Plex App only support <a href="http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html">SubRip Text (SRT)</a> files, and the subtitles contained on those MKVs are rich <a href="http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/ssa.html">SubStationAlpha (ASS/SSA)</a> subtitles.</p>

<p>Apparently the support for both <em>SSA</em> subtitle files and embedded subtitles  were due to Samsung SDK restrictions.</p>

<p>Having no success finding a proper <em>SSA</em> to <em>SRT</em> batch converter (for Linux or OSX), I made a little script to extract those SSA subtitles from the MKVs, and converting each of them into SRT format.</p>

<p>You can grab the script <a href="https://github.com/deivuh/MKV-SRT-Extractor">here</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to have both <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/">MKVToolnix</a> installed</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><!-- ##Why setting up Google DNS as my router's default DNS server was a bad idea# -->


<p>During the last couple of week of last month, I noticed delays while browsing the web, especially Reddit, up to the point that started to bug me. Was it because of the <a href="http://davidhsiehlo.com/blog/2013/12/20/finally/">recent change made by my ISP</a>? Or because I changed my Tomato router to manage my DSL connection?</p>

<p>The first thing I did was a <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3268882393">speed test</a>, but everything seemed to be normal, so it wasn&rsquo;t a speed issue. So the DNS server became my first suspect, since I setup my router to use Google DNS by default, both main and alternate server. But why would Google DNS server be slow? I thought.</p>

<p>So I proceeded to make some tests:</p>

<p>First, I ran a ping test to reddit.com domain:</p>

<pre><code>➜  ~  ping www.reddit.com
PING a659.b.akamai.net (165.254.57.144): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 65.120.60.171: icmp_seq=400 ttl=48 time=89.331 ms
64 bytes from 65.120.60.171: icmp_seq=401 ttl=48 time=93.348 ms
64 bytes from 65.120.60.171: icmp_seq=402 ttl=48 time=92.700 ms
....
64 bytes from 65.120.60.171: icmp_seq=755 ttl=48 time=360.952 ms
64 bytes from 65.120.60.171: icmp_seq=756 ttl=48 time=284.577 ms
64 bytes from 65.120.60.171: icmp_seq=757 ttl=48 time=201.729 ms
</code></pre>

<p>The average was about 90 ms, which is slow but acceptable; but there were times were it reached up to 360+ ms of latency! That&rsquo;s high enough to be noticeable when browsing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, after struggling with BitTorrent clients and online game servers closed port warning and error messages, I’ve been learning about DSL routing and computer networks. That’s when I realised that I would never be able to have an open port or a public IP address to my home network, because my network was behind an ATM Bridge.</p>

<p>Having helped to setup some home networks to some family members, I ran some tests and apparently their DSL router had an actual dynamic public IP address, and were able to have open ports. PPPoE was the type of connection it showed after checking their DSL routers, and they actually had the same ISP. My deduction was that old internet users got stuck with IPoATM connections, and new users had PPPoE connections; it made sense, because when my home’s internet service was acquired, a technician was required to make the router configuration and installation, while new users just had to plug and play their line filters and DSL routers. Until few months ago my solution was to <a href="http://davidhsiehlo.com/blog/2013/12/15/bypassing-a-nat-slash-firewall-by-reverse-ssh-tunneling/">setup a SSH reverse tunnel to access my home network</a>, but with this, I don&rsquo;t need to anymore.</p>

<p>Last week after noticing my internet connection was gone, I called to my ISP tech support, and it went like this:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not until last week, my ISP finally decided to change my home&rsquo;s internet connection from IPoATM to PPPoE, and giving me a more direct access to the internet, thus using my router’s NAT configuration.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Before they made the changes, I had to struggle with server applications or having to figure out how to access my home’s pc while I was at somewhere else. The only benefit I had from this was having a somewhat more secure network, only those connected to the same ATM bridge would have access to my home network. Asking my ISP to setup a port forwarding to my modem wasn’t a choice, since they would just want to try to sell me a <em>public static IP service</em>.</p>
